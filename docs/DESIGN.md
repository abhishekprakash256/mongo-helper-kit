## Mongo Helper Kit - Design Document

### Overview
The Mongo Helper Kit is a Python package that provides helper functions to simplify common MongoDB operations such as connecting to the database, performing CRUD operations, and handling bulk actions. It aims to streamline MongoDB interactions for developers, abstracting away repetitive code for common tasks.


### Architecture

The package follows a modular structure where each module is focused on a specific responsibility:

connection.py: Manages MongoDB connections.
mongo_crud_operations.py: Provides core CRUD functionality.
utils.py: Contains helper functions (e.g., logging, common utilities).
config.py: Handles configuration settings.
Each module is designed to be reusable and maintainable, allowing users to import only what they need.
